# ChordHelper

This repository contains the model training pipeline and datasets used during the learning process. It is part of the ChordHelper application and serves as the V2 approach for music composition.

## Initiative
As a music composer and guitar player, I’ve grown tired of relying solely on triad chords in pop songs. I want to introduce more harmonic diversity into my progressions — enriching the basslines, melodies, and overall musical texture.

To achieve this, I aim to leverage a large language model (LLM) trained on pop song progressions to learn common and advanced harmonic patterns, and provide intelligent chord suggestions to support my composition process.

## Goal
This application integrates harmonic frameworks from jazz, pop, and R&B with modern large language model (LLM) techniques, using fine-tuning to generate musically rich and stylistically diverse chord progressions. 
In addition to building the application, I am using this project as an opportunity to strengthen my machine learning expertise through real-world experimentation and implementation.
